# What is this?
FreeGM is an interface that aims to make game developement easier.
FreeGM works with GMKLib to provide an easy to use interface for SDL2.
FreeGM works by generating the required project files when you press
the "run" button; the project will then be compiled by gcc using SDL2.

# Disclaimer
FreeGM and GMKLib are experimental software, don't expect them to
work reliably for your projects.
